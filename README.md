Converting Kelvin to Celcius.

Kelvin and Celsius are two temperature scales. 
The size of the "degree" for each scale is the same magnitude, but the Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero 
(the lowest temperature theoretically attainable), while the Celsius scale sets its zero point at the triple point of water (the point at which water can exist in solid, liquid, or gaseous states, or 32.01 F).


Converting between the Kelvin and the Celsius requires only basic arithmetic...
